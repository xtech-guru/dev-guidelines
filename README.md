# xTECH Developers Guidelines

Guidelines used by xTECH developers to speed up and simplify their work.

## Repository Structure

Every feature/technology has its guidlines defined in a folder with its name. The documentation is added to a `README.md` file at the root of the folder and any code examples are added to a sub-folder called `code`.
